#include <unistd.h>
Provides access to fork() and process-related system calls.

#include <sys/wait.h>
Required for wait() and waitpid() to clean up child processes.

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
Creates multiple child processes (three in this case).

pid = fork();

Creates a new child process

Returns 0 in the child and child PID in the parent

if (pid == 0)
Identifies the child process.

exit(0);
Terminates the child immediately after execution.

wait(&status)

Parent waits for terminated child processes

Retrieves exit status

Prevents zombie processes

while ((child_pid = wait(&status)) > 0)
Ensures all child processes are cleaned up.

printf("Parent cleaned up child PID: %d\n", child_pid);
Prints the PID of each child reaped by the parent.
